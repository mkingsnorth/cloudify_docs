The following files are made available:

  This is the demonstrator Geometry Nodes setup wrapped as a Blender Modifier Asset.  
  I encourage you to explore your own setups. See the installation notes below.

You will be provided with the following files:

- ``cloudify.blend`` — contains the modifier asset.
- ``blender_assets_cats.txt`` — tells Blender to add the modifier to the *Generate* modifier category.

To install:

1. Save these files together into a new folder where you intend to store your **Blender Asset Library**.

2. If you haven’t already set up an Asset Library, follow these steps:

   a. Open Blender and go to :menuselection:`Edit --> Preferences`.  
   b. Navigate to the :guilabel:`File Paths` section.  
   c. Under :guilabel:`Asset Libraries`, click the :guilabel:`+` button.  
   d. Name the library (e.g. "Cloudify") and select the folder where you saved the Cloudify files.  
   e. Save Preferences.

The asset should now appear in Blender’s Asset Browser.

If you have any issues, please refer to Blender's official documentation on Asset Libraries:
